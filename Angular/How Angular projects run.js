// 1. How Angular projects run?
// TODO: 
// 1. The `index.html` file is the first to render when the Angular application starts.
// 2. The `main.ts` file is the entry point of the application. It initializes and bootstraps the main module.
// 3. The `main.ts` file bootstraps the root module (typically `AppModule`) of the project.
// 4. The `AppModule` is the main module, which contains the metadata and configuration for the application.

// 2. Angular.json?
// TODO:  It contains all the configuration of angular project

// 3. polyfills?
// TODO: imports some script that are required for running angular app

// 4. What is Components?
// TODO: Component is a typeScript class with @Component decorator and it contains methods & properties which we can use in HTML

// 5. Why is Metadata Important in Angular?
// TODO: Metadata tells Angular what a class represents (e.g., a component, module, service, directive, etc.) and how it should behave in the application.
