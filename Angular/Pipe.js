// 1. What are angular pipes?
// TODO: Pipes transform data. Pipes are simple functions designed to accept an input value, process and return a transformed value in a more technical understanding.

// 2. Difference between the pure pipe and impure and async pipe?
// TODO:
// ->  Pure: A pure pipe is only called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe

// -> Impure: An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameter(s) changes.

// -> Async pipe: This simplifies working with asynchronous data in your Angular components by handling subscriptions and automatic updates when new data arrives.
