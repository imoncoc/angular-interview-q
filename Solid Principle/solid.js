// FIXME: Full meaning of SOLID is :

// 1. "S" means -> Single Responsibility Principle
// TODO: : A class or function should have one and only one reason to change.

// 2. "O" means -> Open/Closed Principle 
// TODO: Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.


// 3. "L" means -> Liskov Substitution
// TODO: Imagine we have a class have method eat, sleep, cook, work. here is a problem on if we have parent and child class -> 
// child class can't do cook or work so we make a "HUMAN" a class and inheritance parent and child class like eat and sleep. 
// now parent class can add cook, work.

// 4. "I" means -> Interface Segregation Principle
// TODO: A class should not be forced to implement methods it does not use.

// 5. "D" means -> Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
// TODO: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
